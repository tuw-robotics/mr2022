### Startup

Without path planner (4.4):

`roslaunch mr_goto goto.launch stage:=1 world:=cave.world mode:=1 use_path:=false`

`roslaunch mr_self_localization self_localization.launch map:=cave`

`rosrun rviz rviz`

With path planner (4.4):

`roslaunch mr_goto goto.launch stage:=1 world:=cave.world mode:=1`

`roslaunch mr_self_localization self_localization.launch map:=cave`

`roslaunch mr_path_planner path_planner.launch`

`rosrun rviz rviz`

### 1. Publish the used map

We managed to publish the map which was used by the self localization node to RViz.
The result can be seen in the following figure.

![Published map to RViz](./images/rviz_map.png)

### 2. Initialize self-localization and trigger driving using RViz

We managed to subscribe to **/move_base_simple/goal** and **/initialpose** in the respective nodes, interpret
the received messages and log the received poses. 

### 3. Connect self-localization and planner

We managed to broadcast and receive the robots estimated pose as TF in the respective nodes.
The broadcasted TF can be seen in the following figure.

### 4. Planner

See 3. and 2.

#### 4.1 New Node

We implemented 4.2 and 4.3 in a new node: mr_goto

And 4.4 also in a separate node: mr_path_planner

#### 4.2 Simple, no Obstacle

In the screenshot below you can see the initialpose (left), the goal (green), the odometry history of the way to the goal and the robots estimated pose (yellow)

#### 4.3 Avoid obstacle

TODO

#### 4.4 Plan

DONE
