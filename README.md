### 1. Publish the used map

We managed to publish the map which was used by the self localization node to RViz.
The result can be seen in the following figure.

![Published map to RViz](./images/rviz_map.png)

### 2. Initialize self-localization and trigger driving using RViz

We managed to subscribe to **/move_base_simple/goal** and **/initialpose** in the respective nodes, interpret
the received messages and log the received poses. 

### 3. Connect self-localization and planner

We managed to broadcast and receive the robots estimated pose as TF in the respective nodes.
The broadcasted TF can be seen in the following figure.
