# Overall filter parameters
min_particles: 50

kld_err: 0.01
# Maximum error between the true distribution and the estimated distribution. (default: 0.01)
kld_z: 0.99
# Upper standard normal quantile for (1 - p), where p is the probability that the error on the estimated distrubition will be less than kld_err. (default: 0.99) 
update_min_d: 0.1
# Translational movement required before performing a filter update. (default: 0.2 meters)
update_min_a: 0.26
# Rotational movement required before performing a filter update. (default: π/6.0 radians)
resample_interval: 2
# Number of filter updates required before resampling. (default: 2)
transform_tolerance: 0.5
# Time with which to post-date the transform that is published, to indicate that this transform is valid into the future. (default: 0.1 seconds)
recovery_alpha_slow: 0.001
# Exponential decay rate for the slow average weight filter, used in deciding when to recover by adding random poses. A good value might be 0.001. (default: 0.0 (disabled))
recovery_alpha_fast: 0.1
# Exponential decay rate for the fast average weight filter, used in deciding when to recover by adding random poses. A good value might be 0.1. (default: 0.0 (disabled))
initial_pose_x: 0.0
# Initial pose mean (x), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. (default: 0.0 meters)
initial_pose_y: 0.0
# Initial pose mean (y), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. (default: 0.0 meters)
initial_pose_a: 0.0
# Initial pose mean (yaw), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. (default: 0.0 radians)
initial_cov_xx: 0.25
# Initial pose covariance (x*x), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. (default: 0.5*0.5 meters)
initial_cov_yy: 0.25
# Initial pose covariance (y*y), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. (default: 0.5*0.5 meters)
initial_cov_aa: 0.021816616
# Initial pose covariance (yaw*yaw), used to initialize filter with Gaussian distribution. (default: (π/12)*(π/12))
gui_publish_rate: -1.0
# Maximum rate (Hz) at which scans and paths are published for visualization, -1.0 to disable. (default: -1.0)
save_pose_rate: 0.5
# Maximum rate (Hz) at which to store the last estimated pose and covariance to the parameter server, in the variables initial_pose_* and initial_cov_*. This saved pose will be used on subsequent runs to initialize the filter. -1.0 to disable. (default: 0.5 Hz)
use_map_topic: false
# When set to true, AMCL will subscribe to the map topic rather than making a service call to receive its map. New in navigation 1.4.2 (default: false)
first_map_only: false
# When set to true, AMCL will only use the first map it subscribes to, rather than updating each time a new one is received. New in navigation 1.4.2 (default: false)
